By completing a familiar end-to-end project, which starts by loading the data and ends by creating and calling an online inference endpoint, the user should become familiar with the core concepts of Azure ML and their most common usage. Each step of this tutorial can be modified or performed in other ways that might have security or scalability advantages. We will cover some of those in the Part II of this tutorial, however, we suggest the reader use the provide links in each section to learn more on each topic."
